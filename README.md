# Book Manager

## Objective
The objective behind implementing this application is to improve my abilities as a web developer. Basically, to gain experience with the MEAN Stack, which is Mongo DB, Express.js, Angular JS, and Node.js. In this project I am using Angular Material instead of Bootstrap.

## What can this manager do?
This application can be used by someone who wants to keep a collection of books well organized. Using the application, the user can update the list that represents the actual collection. Updating the list means adding, editing or removing a book. Furthermore, it is possible to mark a book as borrowed whenever the user lends a item of the collection to someone.
